# Weekly-Water-prediction-end-end
For life and nature, water is an essential resource. On the earth, there is enough freshwater for
all, but it is irregularly distributed and much of it is wasted, polluted, and managed erroneously.
Greater than 25 percent of the worldâ€™s population do not have an approach to clean water. In
the organization of resources like water, human negligence can cause wastage of a huge volume
of water or a fallacy in the supply management can deny basic facilities to people. With the
existing system of water supply for domestic purposes, there are quite a few common causes of
ill-timely supply of water and there is a need to predict the usage of water and to automate the
supply of water.This is a project consisting of weekly water prediction using machine learning and deploying the model into AWS EC2 instance
